Deployment Steps:

Create RDS PostgreSQL Instance: Set up an RDS instance with appropriate size and configuration.
Create Elastic Beanstalk Environment: Create an Elastic Beanstalk environment, choosing Python as your platform. Upload your application code, either as a ZIP file or within a Docker container.
Configure API Gateway (Optional): If you choose to use API Gateway, create a new API, link it to your Elastic Beanstalk environment, and configure routes, authorization, etc.
Create Lambda Function: Create a Lambda function, selecting Python as the runtime. Upload your Python data ingestion script and install any necessary dependencies (e.g., psycopg2-binary, etc.).
Create EventBridge Rule: Create a scheduled rule in EventBridge to trigger your Lambda function on a schedule.
Store Data in S3: Upload your raw weather data files to an S3 bucket.
Configure Secrets Manager: Store your database credentials securely in Secrets Manager and give your Lambda function and API permission to access them.
Set Up CloudWatch: Configure logging and alerting for your resources.
